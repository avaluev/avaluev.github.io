## 💼 Current Role: SXOPE (Jan 2024 – Present)

**Senior AI Product Manager - AI Healthcare Copilot & Disease Prediction**

HIPAA, ISO 27001, and SOC 2-compliant AI healthcare ecosystem transforming US value-based care for **100K+ patients** and **1K+ primary care physicians**.

### Key Achievements

#### 📊 Scaled AI Clinical Recommendations from Pilot to 100K+ Patients
- Led discovery study with 50 physicians proving 60% adoption and 35% time savings
- Secured C-suite investment approval through data-driven stakeholder presentations
- Custom SQL dashboards and interactive ROI models drove annual budget allocation
- **Impact:** Transformed healthcare delivery for value-based care systems

#### ⚡ Reduced ML Model Deployment Cycles by 75% (7 months)
- Established unified product roadmap bridging clinical and ML workflows
- Implemented self-service BI dashboards enabling 11-person clinical/data science team
- Collaborative model building, evaluation, and deployment of chronic disease prediction models
- **Result:** 8-week validation cycles → 2-week cycles (enabled weekly releases)

#### 🎯 Launched AI-Driven Patient Prioritization Engine (3 months)
- Replaced random patient scheduling with risk-stratified model
- Deployed across **100+ clinics** with emergency risk and multi-factor engagement scoring
- **Impact:** Identified most vulnerable patients, optimized care delivery

#### 🛡️ Mitigated Clinical Risk & Saved 400+ Engineering Hours Annually
- Delivered ML validation pipeline using synthetic patient-physician encounters
- Stress-tested AI Clinical Notes platform with intentionally flawed scenarios
- Built multi-modal ground truth packages (Gemini TTS audio, structured SOAP notes, timestamp-traceable Evidence Registry)
- Hardened system against documentation errors while eliminating all patient data exposure
- **Technical approach:** AI-assisted development, rapid prototyping, production-grade testing

### Leadership in Action

**Building Trust-Based Validation with Domain Experts**
CMO validation bottleneck required 8-week manual cycles via Google Sheets. I designed and shipped the **Control Board**—a self-service validation dashboard enabling CMO to independently verify model predictions with one-click production deployment authority.
- **Impact:** 8 weeks → 2 weeks (75% reduction) | CMO gained deployment control | 100% adoption
- **Orchestrated:** 12-team integration alignment, multi-team data pipeline coordination, stakeholder management

**Managing Brilliant High-Performers (Complex Leadership)**
Inherited toxic team dynamic: brilliant Data Scientist delivering exceptional work but publicly berating teammates. Lacked firing authority due to CEO protection. Applied pragmatic leadership:
1. Extracted institutional knowledge via strategic new hire
2. Redirected high-performer to CEO-sponsored initiatives (leveraged ego for separation)
3. Protected team through structural isolation while preserving business value
4. Shipped AI prioritization system proving approach works
- **Result:** Team morale 40% → 85% | Attrition cancelled | $4M project delivered | Business value preserved without termination

**Creating Cross-Functional Collaboration Framework**
Data Scientists optimized for AUC/precision; physicians cared about clinical interpretability (and patient safety). Created structured Research Hypothesis Template requiring joint physician-engineer ownership. Built Control Board as shared validation tool.
- **Impact:** Model rejection rate 60% → <10% | Cross-team conflict transformed to partnership

**Strategic Disease Prioritization Framework**
Eliminated arbitrary model selection through weighted scoring: manual rule overlap (knockout), patient population size, clinical detectability, historical diagnosis rate, undiagnosed patient estimate.
- **Impact:** Roadmap transparency (12-month disease pipeline), wasted research cycles eliminated, quarterly planning 3 weeks → 2 days

## 🎓 Leadership Philosophy

My approach to leadership centers on **psychological safety, strategic pragmatism, and low-ego coaching**:

### Core Principles

1. **Protect Team Culture Over Perfect Outcomes**
   - Sometimes imperfect solutions that preserve team wellbeing beat theoretically optimal approaches
   - Transparent about constraints: "I can't fire him, but here's how I'll protect you"
   - Psychological safety correlates with product quality (especially in high-stakes AI like healthcare)

2. **Influence > Authority**
   - Build alliances, create paper trails, leverage ego strategically
   - Navigate matrix organizations without formal power through collaboration and credibility
   - Meet teams where they are; offer help, not just asks

3. **Empower Domain Experts**
   - Self-service validation tools > gatekeeping technical decisions
   - Give non-technical stakeholders deployment control with appropriate guardrails
   - Democratizing control accelerates innovation

4. **Strategic Knowledge Management**
   - Never confront toxic high-performers until you've eliminated their "irreplaceable" status
   - Document institutional knowledge disguised as team expansion
   - Succession planning is insurance policy

5. **Pragmatic Problem-Solving**
   - Accept 80% solutions that are politically possible over 100% solutions that aren't
   - Honest transparency builds more trust than false promises
   - Sometimes you must pause feature delivery to fix foundations (infrastructure before scale)

## 📖 Why I Write About Career Growth

After 11+ years building products and leading teams, I realized technical excellence alone isn't enough—**how you communicate your impact** determines career trajectory. I started coaching because senior engineers often underestimate their achievements and struggle to articulate leadership impact.

My philosophy: Great engineers should lead great companies. If my resume coaching helps 100+ engineers tell their stories better, they'll make better products.
