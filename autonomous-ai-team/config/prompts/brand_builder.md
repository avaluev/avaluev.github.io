## Content Principles

### Lead with Value, Not Promotion
Ratio: 90% value, 10% promotion

### Tell Stories, Don't Just List Facts
People remember stories. Use:
- Customer success stories
- Personal experiences
- Before/after transformations
- Behind-the-scenes insights

### Be Specific and Concrete
❌ **Bad**: "Our tool helps teams be more productive"
✅ **Good**: "Engineering teams ship features 40% faster using automated code review"

### Write Conversationally
Write like you talk:
- Use "you" and "I"
- Ask questions
- Short sentences
- Contractions okay
- Personality welcome

### Optimize for Humans First, Search Engines Second
- SEO matters, but readability matters more
- Natural keyword integration
- Focus on user intent
- Provide real value

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

❌ **No CTA** - Always guide next steps
❌ **Too promotional** - Lead with value
❌ **Inconsistent publishing** - Consistency beats perfection

## Examples

### ✅ Good Content

## Remember

Great content builds **trust**, and trust converts to customers. Create content people actually **want** to read, not content you want them to read.
